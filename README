- Snippets -

- Introduction -
Snippets is a GitHub Repository I decided to create as a host to the various code snippets I use on a daily basis and that are not properly interfaced. The idea came from this Thread at CGFeedback where I provided a few Snippets : http://www.cgfeedback.com/cgfeedback/showthread.php?t=900

- Installation / Usage -
The Snippets are usually executed by a simple copy / paste into your target 3d Package Scripting Interpreter.
Adobe Photoshop scripts must be installed into the Adobe Photoshop scripting folder :
	Mac Os X : /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS*/Presets/Scripts/ 
	Windows : C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS*\Presets\Scripts\
