- Snippets -

- Introduction -
Snippets is a GitHub Repository I decided to create as a host to the various code snippets I use on a daily basis and that are not properly interfaced. The idea came from this Thread at CGFeedback where I provided a few Snippets: http://www.cgfeedback.com/cgfeedback/showthread.php?t=900

- Installation / Usage -
The Snippets are usually executed by a simple copy / paste into your target 3d Package Scripting Interpreter.
Adobe Photoshop scripts must be installed into the Adobe Photoshop scripting folder:
	Mac Os X: /Applications/Adobe Photoshop CS*/Presets/Scripts/
	Windows: C:\Program Files\Adobe\Adobe Photoshop CS*\Presets\Scripts\

Alternatively, on Maya, a Snippets Loader is provided, it requries PyQt.
Launching it is done issuing the following Python code:

import sys

LOADER_PATH = "Path/To/Snippets/Folder/Snippets/src/maya"

if LOADER_PATH not in sys.path:
	sys.path.append(LOADER_PATH)

import snippets.loader
reload(snippets.loader)

import snippets.ui.common
UI = snippets.loader.Loader(snippets.ui.ui.common.getMayaWindow())
UI.show()
